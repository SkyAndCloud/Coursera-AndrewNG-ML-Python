    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Compute the cost function and gradient for collaborative
    #               filtering. Concretely, you should first implement the cost
    #               function (without regularization) and make sure it is
    #               matches our costs. After that, you should implement the
    #               gradient and use the checkCostFunction routine to check
    #               that the gradient is correct. Finally, you should implement
    #               regularization.

    # Notes: X - num_movies  x num_features matrix of movie features
    #        Theta - num_users  x num_features matrix of user features
    #        Y - num_movies x num_users matrix of user ratings of movies
    #        R - num_movies x num_users matrix, where R(i, j) = 1 if the
    #            i-th movie was rated by the j-th user
